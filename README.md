# DDoS Detection using ANN  

## ðŸ“Œ What is a DDoS Attack?  
A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack** is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. Attackers use multiple compromised systems to generate excessive requests, making the target system slow or completely unavailable.  

### ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project builds an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model to classify network traffic as **BENIGN** or **DDoS** using a dataset of network flow features.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- **Data Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, feature selection, standardization)  
- **ANN Model Implementation** for binary classification  
- **Performance Metrics & Visualization**  

## ðŸ’» Installation  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Install dependencies using:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
